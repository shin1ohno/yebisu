# Simulator CI

The `simulator-smoke` job runs on GitHub-hosted `macos-26` for pull requests,
pushes to main and manual dispatch, with read-only contents permission and a
40-minute timeout. It installs XcodeGen and just, then uses the pinned Rust
toolchain and the continuously monitored 6 GiB disk guard.

`scripts/ios/ci-smoke.py` selects the newest installed iOS runtime that already
has an available iPad Pro 13-inch device and creates a disposable Simulator of
that device type. Non-numeric runtime suffixes are skipped with a log message. It calls
the same `scripts/ios/smoke-check.py` used by `just ios-sim`, without changing
the oracle: bundle/build, boot, install, launch, XCTest input and lifecycle
actions, screenshots and receiving-side paint/input/counter validation all
must succeed. It attempts shutdown and deletes its own Simulator on success or
failure. A cleanup line records the shutdown exit code and successful deletion;
a failed shutdown does not prevent deletion.

Unlike the local default, CI supplies a fresh Simulator UDID rather than relying
on a pre-existing M5 Simulator name or saved app data. The simulator bundle uses
ad-hoc signing; the XCTest bundle disables signing. No developer identity,
unlocked login keychain, secrets or owner's hosts are required. The P0 smoke
screen is local to the app. The existing check job remains separate.

Fresh Simulators can actually rotate where an existing local Simulator did not.
XCTest can export a landscape PNG with portrait IHDR dimensions and TIFF eXIf
orientation 8. The shared PNG decoder applies that display orientation before
the existing oracle maps paint receipts to pixels. All colour thresholds,
required stages, inputs and counter assertions remain unchanged; ignoring the
metadata would sample unrelated pixels. Tests cover all eight orientations.

Run the same CI entry point locally with
`just guarded python3 scripts/ios/ci-smoke.py`. Locally, timestamped capture
directories remain in `target/ios-smoke/`, including the XCTest result,
screenshots and app receipts; `target/ios-smoke/latest.json` identifies the last
successful capture and `target/ios-smoke/build/` holds derived build data.
In CI, an `if: always()` step uploads the capture directories as the
`simulator-smoke-evidence` Actions artifact even after a failed smoke step,
provided evidence was produced. The artifact excludes `build/` and the local
`latest.json` pointer. Download it from the workflow run; the runner's local
files disappear when the job finishes. This checks Simulator
rendering and lifecycle behavior, not physical IME or hardware keyboard behavior.
